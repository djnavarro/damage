The goal of damage is to make generative art. You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("djnavarro/damage")
```

The particular conceit of this system is that every release of the system generates pieces in a slightly different style (i.e., the output is different depending on which version of the package you have installed). This is version 0.3. To generate pieces:

```{r, fig.height=10, fig.width=10, dpi=300}
library(damage)
damage(seed = 1)
damage(seed = 2)
damage(seed = 3)
```
