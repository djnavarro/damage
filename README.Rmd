The goal of damage is to make generative art. You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("djnavarro/damage")
```

To generate pieces:

```{r, fig.height=10, fig.width=10, dpi=300}
library(damage)
damage(seed = 11)
damage(seed = 12)
damage(seed = 13)
```
